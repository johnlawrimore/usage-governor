# Changelog

All notable changes to usage-governor are documented here. Versioning follows
[semver](https://semver.org/): breaking changes to the JSON output contract bump the major
version, new fields or flags bump the minor, fixes bump the patch.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Pace-aware posture.** Posture is now scored on two independent axes, worst rung wins: the
  percent a limit sits at, and the pace it is burning at. A new `pace` field per limit exposes
  `{ratio, exhaust_seconds}`, where `ratio` = current burn rate / the rate affordable before reset
  (equivalently `seconds_to_reset / seconds_to_exhaustion`). A `ratio` above 1 means the window
  empties before it resets, so a low-percent limit burning too fast now escalates instead of reading
  as "all clear". This fixes the case where a 20% session on a fast burn was reported as fine.
- **Finer five-rung posture ladder:** `normal` / `measured` / `frugal` / `conserve` / `wind_down`,
  replacing the three-rung ladder. The new `measured` rung reacts early (session ~50%+, or pace
  ratio ~1.0-1.25) instead of staying silent until 75%; `conserve` sits between `frugal` and
  `wind_down`. An absolute-runway backstop floors pace at `conserve` when a window will empty within
  ~30 minutes.

### Changed

- Percent bands per kind: session / scoped / unknown escalate at 50/75/90/97%; `weekly_all` at
  55/80/90/95%. Previously a limit was `frugal` at 75/80% and `wind_down` at a flat 90%; readings in
  the 90-97% range are now `conserve` rather than `wind_down`.
- The no-op floor is now `posture == normal` (both axes clear), so a pace-critical limit is no
  longer silenced by a low percent.

### Note on the output contract

The `posture` string is advisory guidance for a reader (an agent adapts its plan to it), not a
stable machine enum. Its set of values and the input-to-value mapping may change as the policy is
tuned, as they did here. The stable part of the JSON output contract is field presence and shape
(a `posture` string is always present; each limit carries `percent`, `burn`, `pace`, etc.), not the
specific posture words. Callers should not hard-code a switch over posture values; read the numeric
fields (`percent`, `pace.ratio`) if they need stable branching. This is why the posture change ships
as a minor (1.1.0) rather than a major: the field contract is unchanged, only the advisory values.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Initial public release.
- `SKILL.md`: governance instructions for Claude Code (posture-driven throttling, the no-op
  floor, per-model budget checks, failure modes).
- `scripts/check-usage.py`: stdlib-only usage reader with deterministic posture
  (`normal` / `frugal` / `wind_down`), burn rate over a recent window, time-to-reset,
  5-minute caching, 429 backoff, and forward-compatible parsing of unknown limit kinds.
- Cross-platform launchers (`check-usage.sh`, `check-usage.cmd`) with working-interpreter
  detection.
- Stdlib `unittest` suite and GitHub Actions CI (Linux + Windows, Python 3.9 and 3.13).
