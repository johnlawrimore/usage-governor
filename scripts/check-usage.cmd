rem Launcher: locate a WORKING Python 3 interpreter and run check-usage.py with the same args.
rem The logic lives in check-usage.py; this wrapper is the Windows entry point.
rem
rem Each candidate is validated with `-c "import sys"` before use so the Windows Store
rem "python.exe" app-execution-alias stub (which prints an install message and exits nonzero)
rem is skipped instead of being run. `exit /b` with no argument is deliberate: it preserves the
rem interpreter's real exit code, whereas `exit /b %errorlevel%` inside a parenthesized block
rem would be expanded at parse time and always report 0.
