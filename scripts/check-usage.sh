# The logic lives in check-usage.py; this wrapper only exists so the documented command
# (check-usage.sh) keeps working.
#
# Each candidate is validated with `-c 'import sys'` before use, so a stub on PATH that merely
# prints a message and exits nonzero (instead of being a real interpreter) is skipped rather than
# exec'd.
